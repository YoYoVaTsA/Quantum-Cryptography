# Quantum-Cryptography
A project for sure but not a software though, things needed to get started with quantum cryptography.


Project Initiator
--Mohneesh Sreegirisetty

Project Contributers
--Anyone

The main aim of my project is no one goes to google getting the info he needs and putting together the raw data which would be a heck of a work.
So I think that contributing to the people in this field and helping each other would be good enough.....
So submit your project materials that you wish to share and I would do the same........
C'mon lets spread the word 'Q' 'U' 'A' 'N' 'T' 'U' 'M' "C" "R" "Y" "P" "T" "O" "G" "R" "A" "P" "H" "Y"
